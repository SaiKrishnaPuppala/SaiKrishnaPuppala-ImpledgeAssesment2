I have completed both exercises of adding and deleting package using automation with selenium web driver

Saved the code seperatly in 2 files named automaition1 and automation2

If you want to run and check, copy paste code in above to selenium webdriver environment with java and you can run it directly

# sql

i have written queries for given test and uploaded as a text file

# postman

coming to postman task i didnot understand the instructin clearly

Thank you-
