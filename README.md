# SaiKrishnaPuppala-ImpledgeAssesment2-automation

I have completed both exercises of adding and deleting package using automation with selenium web driver

Saved the code seperatly in 2 files named automaition1 and automation2

If you want to run and check, copy paste code in above to selenium webdriver environment with java and you can run it directly

Thank you-
